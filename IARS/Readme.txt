% The Matlab Code (Version 2.0) is created by ZHANG Yabin,
% Nanyang Technological University, 2016-06-27
% which is based on the method described in the following paper 
% [1] Aspect Ratio Similarity (ARS) for Image Retargeting Quality Assessment. ICASSP 2016
% [2] Backward Registration Based Aspect Ratio Similarity (ARS) for Image Retargeting Quality Assessment. TIP
% website: http://yabinzhangjohn.github.io/
% The Matlab codes are for non-comercial use only.

The code has been tested on the Windows 7 64-bit OS.
To run the code: prepare the MIT RetargetMe dataset and then run the MIT_ARS_main.m

Note that it takes around 1.5 hours on Win 7 (i5 @3.2GHz and 16GB ram).

NOTE: if the mex files are incompatible, run the COMPUTE_MEX.m to replace the existing mex files with the new generated ones.
